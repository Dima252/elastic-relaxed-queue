# Concurrent Queue Algorithms: MSQ, RCQB, and Elastic Relaxation

A Java implementation and comparative study of three concurrent queue algorithms,
developed as the final project for the **Multi-Core Programming** course.

The project follows a clear academic progression: implement the classic 1996 baseline,
then the 2022 state-of-the-art relaxed structure, then contribute an original adaptive
variant that combines ideas from both papers.

---

## The Problem

A concurrent queue shared between producer and consumer threads must protect its
`head` and `tail` pointers from simultaneous writes. The standard tool is
**Compare-And-Swap (CAS)**: read a pointer, compute a new value, write it only if
no one else changed it since the read. Under low concurrency this works well. Under
heavy load, every thread races to CAS the same pointer — most fail, spin, and retry.
**Throughput collapses even as more hardware is added.**

The two academic papers this project is based on each take a different approach to
this bottleneck.

## The Three Algorithms

### 1 · MSQ — Michael-Scott Queue
**Source:** Michael & Scott, PODC 1996
**File:** `src/queue/MichaelScottQueue.java`

The textbook lock-free FIFO queue. A singly-linked list with a sentinel (dummy)
head node and two `AtomicReference` pointers.

**Enqueue:** CAS on `tail.next` (null → new node), then swing `tail` forward.
If another thread's enqueue is half-done (tail is lagging), this thread helps
advance it before retrying — the "helping" pattern from the paper.

**Dequeue:** reads the value at `head.next` *before* the CAS — this is a critical
ordering detail from §D12 of the paper. Then CAS `head` forward to the next node.

**Ordering:** strict FIFO. Items come out in exactly the order they went in.

**Bottleneck:** all N enqueuers fight over a single `tail` pointer. One CAS winner
per round; the rest spin. At 16+ threads, throughput plateaus and then falls.

---

### 2 · RCQB — Relaxed Concurrent Queue (Blocking)
**Source:** Kappes & Anastasiadis, ACM TOPC 2022, §5, Listings 1–3
**File:** `src/queue/RCQBQueue.java`

A faithful Java adaptation of the RCQB algorithm from the Kappes paper.

**Core structural difference from MSQ:** instead of a linked list with dynamic
node allocation, RCQB uses a **fixed-size circular array of pre-allocated slots**.
Each slot is a four-state machine:

```
FREE  →  ENQPEND  →  OCCUPIED  →  DEQPEND  →  FREE
```

**Enqueue — stage 1 (assign):** `tail.getAndIncrement() & mask` is a fetch-and-add
(FAA) that gives each enqueuer a unique slot index. This step is contention-free —
no CAS, no failure possible.

**Enqueue — stage 2 (update):** CAS `FREE → ENQPEND` to claim the slot, write the
data, then set `OCCUPIED`. If two enqueuers land on the same slot (possible when the
array wraps), only one wins; the other spins on the current slot state.

**Dequeue:** claims a slot index via CAS on `head`; waits for the slot to reach
`OCCUPIED` (spin up to MAX_SPINS, then `synchronized wait/notifyAll`); CAS
`OCCUPIED → DEQPEND`; reads data; sets `FREE`.

**Ordering:** relaxed FIFO. Items can be dequeued out of insertion order by up to
`(N−1) × min(ke, kd−1)` positions (Theorem 1 of the paper).

**Bounded buffer:** the array holds at most N items (default 256). Enqueuers block
when all slots are full — this requires concurrent dequeuers to be running.

**Java adaptations vs. the paper:**
- `head` uses **CAS instead of FAA** so `dequeue()` can return `null` on an empty
  queue. The paper's RCQB uses FAA and blocks indefinitely (partial-method semantics).
- Sleep/wake uses `synchronized + wait(1ms)/notifyAll` instead of Linux futex.
  Semantics are identical; the implementation primitive differs.
- No separate `waiters` counter because our CAS-on-head guarantees at most one
  dequeuer per slot at any time.

---

### 3 · ERQ — Elastic Relaxed Queue
**Our original contribution**
**Files:** `src/queue/ElasticRelaxedQueue.java`, `src/queue/Lane.java`,
`src/queue/ContentionMonitor.java`

An adaptive queue that does not exist in either paper. It borrows the FAA-based
round-robin assignment idea from Paper 2 and adds a self-tuning controller that
dynamically adjusts how many parallel operation sites are active.

**Core idea:** maintain an array of K independent MS-queue *lanes*. K starts at 1
(identical behaviour to a plain MS queue, strict FIFO). As CAS failure rate rises,
K expands — operations fan out across more lanes, reducing per-lane contention at
the cost of relaxed ordering. When load drops, K contracts back toward 1.

**Enqueue:** FAA on `enqCounter` gives a lane index (`counter % K`). If the CAS on
that lane's tail fails, `enqCounter` was already incremented — the next attempt lands
on a different lane automatically, spreading retries without extra logic.

**Dequeue:** scans up to `scanHighWater` lanes in round-robin and returns the first
non-null result. `scanHighWater` is the high-watermark of K ever reached and never
decreases — this prevents a correctness bug where K contracts after an item is
written to a now-inactive lane, silently losing that item.

**ContentionMonitor:** thread-local `long[]` arrays accumulate CAS outcomes with
zero shared-memory writes per record. Every 64 ops the local window flushes to a
`LongAdder` (striped cells — far faster than `AtomicLong` under write contention).

**Elasticity controller (inline, no background thread):** every 1024 completed
operations one thread samples the global failure rate and either expands K
(rate > 30%) or contracts K (rate < 5%) via a single CAS on `activeLanes`. Inline
checks avoid the OS scheduling jitter that a background thread would introduce into
latency measurements.

## How to Build and Run

```bash
# Build (any OS with Java 8+)
mkdir -p bin
find src -name "*.java" | xargs javac -d bin

# 3-way benchmark: MSQ vs RCQB vs ERQ
java -cp bin benchmark.BenchmarkMain

# 31 correctness tests (no items lost or duplicated)
java -cp bin benchmark.CorrectnessTest

# One-shot build + benchmark on Linux/macOS/university server
bash compile.sh run
```

> If you get `OutOfMemoryError` at 512–1024 threads, add `-Xss256k` to reduce
> the per-thread stack size.

## Correctness Tests — 31 / 31 Passing

```
java -cp bin benchmark.CorrectnessTest
```

| Test group | Queues tested | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| Single-threaded FIFO | MSQ | Items dequeued in exact insertion order |
| Dequeue-empty | MSQ, RCQB, ERQ | Returns `null`, no hang, no exception |
| No-loss, drain-after, 2/4/8/16 threads | MSQ, ERQ | Zero items lost with N enqueuers only |
| No-loss, concurrent-deq, 2/4/8/16 threads | MSQ, RCQB, ERQ | Zero items lost or duplicated with simultaneous enqueuers + dequeuers |
| Stress, 64 threads, concurrent-deq | MSQ, RCQB, ERQ | Same at high concurrency |

RCQB skips the drain-after tests because it is a bounded ring buffer — filling all
slots with no concurrent dequeuers running causes enqueuers to block forever.

## Benchmark Results

**Platform:** Windows 11 · AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D (8 physical cores / 16 logical threads)
· OpenJDK 1.8.0_482 (Eclipse Temurin) · 100,000 ops/thread · 50 % enqueue / 50 % dequeue.
Run `java -cp bin benchmark.BenchmarkMain` to reproduce.

| Threads | MSQ (M ops/s) | RCQB (M ops/s) | ERQ (M ops/s) |
|--------:|--------------:|---------------:|--------------:|
| 1       | 14.4          | **24.9**       | 13.5          |
| 2       | 16.7          | **22.2**       | 7.6           |
| 4       | 14.9          | **32.9**       | 9.7           |
| 8       | 9.7           | **41.4**       | 20.0          |
| 16      | 6.2           | 15.7           | **32.2**      |
| 32      | 6.9           | 15.8           | **21.1**      |

*All values in M ops/sec. Bold = winner at that thread count.
Measured up to 32 threads — beyond that, RCQB's blocking sleep/wake mechanism
becomes increasingly slow under Windows thread scheduling at 4× oversubscription.*

**What the numbers prove:**

- **MSQ degrades steadily.** Throughput drops from ~15 M/s at 1 thread to ~7 M/s
  at 32 threads and stays there. Every enqueuer fights over the same single `tail`
  CAS; one wins per round, the rest retry.

- **RCQB peaks at 8 threads (41.4 M/s — 4× faster than MSQ).** The FAA slot
  assignment is contention-free by design: no CAS, no failure possible. The sharp
  drop at 16 threads is because RCQB is a *blocking* algorithm — dequeuers that
  find an empty slot sleep for up to 1 ms. Once threads outnumber physical cores
  (8 cores on this machine), wake-up latency accumulates and throughput collapses.
  This is exactly the trade-off the Kappes paper warns about for blocking algorithms
  on oversubscribed systems (§3, §7.2).

- **ERQ overtakes RCQB at 16 threads (32.2 vs 15.7 M/s) and stays ahead.** ERQ is
  fully lock-free — no sleeping, no wake-up cost. By 16 threads the elasticity
  controller has expanded K to multiple lanes, spreading CAS pressure across them.

- **Crossover point (ERQ beats MSQ): 8 threads (20.0 vs 9.7 M/s).**
  RCQB beats MSQ from thread 1 because the pre-allocated array eliminates
  `new Node()` heap allocation on every enqueue.

## What Remains To Be Done (MOATAZ)

### 1 · Print K during the benchmark (Priority: High)

The report needs to show that the elastic mechanism actually fires.
Refactor `runBenchmark` in [BenchmarkMain.java](src/benchmark/BenchmarkMain.java)
to accept a pre-created queue instance so you can inspect it after the run:

```java
ElasticRelaxedQueue<Integer> erq = new ElasticRelaxedQueue<>();
System.out.println(runBenchmark("ERQ ", erq, n));
System.out.printf("      final K=%d  failRate=%.1f%%%n",
        erq.getActiveLanes(), erq.getFailureRate() * 100);
```

Expected: K=1 at 1–4 threads, growing toward 8–20 at 32+ threads.

#### DONE
But instead of printing the final K, I'm printing the final K and the maximum K that was used. The Changes were donr in the Elastic Queue class, and the Main Benchmark file.

### 2 · Tune constants for the university server (Priority: High)

The values in [ElasticRelaxedQueue.java](src/queue/ElasticRelaxedQueue.java) were
chosen on a laptop. On the server adjust and re-run:

| Constant | Current | Try first |
|---|---|---|
| `HIGH_THRESHOLD` | `0.30` | `0.20` — expand sooner |
| `CHECK_INTERVAL` | `1024` | `512` — react faster |
| `MAX_LANES` | `64` | Physical core count of the server |

#### Not Done yet 
I flattened the folder so we could be able to run it on the server, and renamed the main benchmark file to MppRunner because it is what we are currently checking on the server. I ran some tests. with 0.2 max threshold and 512 interval the results were bad. The server fell down so i stopped.

### 3 · Write the report analysis section (Priority: High)

Minimum required content:

- Throughput table: MSQ / RCQB / ERQ at every thread count from the benchmark.
- Crossover point: the first thread count where ERQ beats MSQ.
- Cite **Theorem 1** from Kappes & Anastasiadis (2022): with K lanes the maximum
  FIFO deviation per item is `(K−1) × min(T_e, T_d−1)`. At K=1 this is 0 —
  strictly equivalent to a plain MS queue.
- Explain why MSQ degrades: N threads compete on one `tail` CAS; throughput equals
  one CAS latency, not N × (one CAS latency).
- Explain why RCQB scales: the assign step (FAA) is contention-free; CAS contention
  is local to one slot at a time.
- Explain why ERQ scales: CAS pressure is spread over K lanes; K auto-adjusts so
  the queue pays for exactly as much parallelism as the current load requires.

#### Not Done yet
